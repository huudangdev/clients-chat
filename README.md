# Technical stack
Here is the technical stack that you are using for this app :
WebSockets and socket.io
WebSockets is a protocol that allows a bilateral synchronous exchange between a client and a server.
In the classic web, a client requests to a server and a server responds sending it back the data. This system is impossible for a chat app.
In WebSockets, the server can send data to the client, but the client can too ! A WebSocket is a kind of communication pipe opened in two directions.
Socket.io is a library based on this protocol to make the use of WebSockets easier.
The Javascript mafia
Node.js is a Javascript back-end technology executed by the server as PHP, Ruby or Python. JavaScript uses events. Node.js keeps this particularity so it is easy to make asynchronous code.
Node.js comes with its own package manager: npm. It becomes easy to install, update, delete packages.
